### Dual-Mode Autonomous and Manual Firefighting Robot

This repository contains the complete Arduino-based implementation of a dual-mode firefighting robot designed to navigate autonomously or manually within a grid-based arena, detect simulated fires, and deploy a servo-driven ladder mechanism for fire suppression.

#### Project Overview:

* **Objective:** Develop a compact, reliable robotic platform capable of autonomously detecting and responding to simulated fire scenarios, with a manual override via wireless control.
* **Platform:** Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller, custom 4WD chassis, and integrated sensor suite.

#### Implementation and Key Features:

* **Dual Operational Modes:**

  * **Autonomous Mode:** Utilizes a finite state machine (FSM) for robust grid navigation, obstacle detection, and fire identification.
  * **Manual Mode:** Offers remote joystick-based control via nRF24L01 wireless modules for precision movement and servo actuation.

* **Sensor Integration:**

  * **IR Line Sensor:** Tracks grid navigation.
  * **IR Receiver Module:** Detects modulated IR signals representing fire.
  * **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04):** Front-mounted obstacle detection and precise wall alignment.

* **Actuation System:**

  * **Servo Motors:**

    * Side-mounted servo-actuated ladder for precise and repeatable fire extinguishing.
    * Servo rotation angles precisely controlled for targeted fire suppression.

* **Wireless Communication:**

  * **nRF24L01 Modules:** Facilitates wireless telemetry and real-time command handoff.
  * Enables real-time debugging, state transition monitoring, and emergency overrides.

* **Hardware and Physical Design:**

  * Compact design adhering to a 20Ã—20 cm footprint constraint.
  * Multi-level chassis for efficient component management and optimized weight distribution.

#### Control Logic and Software:\*\*

* **Finite State Machine (FSM):** Manages robot states clearly defined for autonomous operations including navigation, fire detection, and ladder deployment.
* **Telemetry and Debugging:** Real-time logging of key events like wall detections, fire sightings, and ladder actions via wireless telemetry.

#### Innovations and Enhancements:\*\*

* **Wireless Command and Telemetry:** Real-time FSM state monitoring and remote intervention capabilities.
* **Asynchronous Ultrasonic Sensing:** Non-blocking ultrasonic measurements enhance navigation precision and responsiveness.
* **Dynamic Grid Mapping:** Efficient bitmap tracking for comprehensive area coverage.
* **Enhanced Fire Detection:** Triangulation-based infrared sensor array to rapidly identify fire direction.

#### Strengths and Weaknesses:\*\*

* **Strengths:** Dual-mode functionality, modular FSM architecture, precise mechanical ladder deployment, integrated sensor suite, and compact mechanical layout.
* **Weaknesses:** Limited resolution for line tracking, fixed fire-source assumption, open-loop servo operation, and potential range limitations of wireless control.

#### Future Development:\*\*

* Improved sensor arrays for higher navigation accuracy.
* Closed-loop ladder deployment with feedback mechanisms.
* Enhanced fault detection and recovery mechanisms for robust autonomy.

This project effectively demonstrates key principles of mechatronics, embedded system integration, and autonomous robotics, providing a solid framework for further research and practical enhancements.
